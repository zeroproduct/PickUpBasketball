# Pick Up Basketball
A Simple Pick Up Basketball App for SJSU (made for iOS)

---

I created this app to eliminate the hassle of gathering up individuals or groups of people for a game of pick up basketball in our open court gyms. On the San Jose State University campus, there are roughly 4 open court hours for all students to play basketball. SJSU will be opening up a recreation center in the near future, which will have an additional 3 courts. With all these courts, and with the inconvenience of setting up pick up games, I felt that creating this app would benefit the flow and efficiency between games.


This program was developed in Xcode with Swift 2 and Firebase as a backend. This app is still a work in progress!
